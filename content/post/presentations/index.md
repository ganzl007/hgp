<hr>

#### Don't insult and slander others in your speech
#### Take a deep breath before giving a speech, stay confident, and then walk to the podium with a smile
#### Be prepared to answer questions.
#### You have to remember that almost no one in the audience is willing to swap roles with you, so you have to be confident.
#### You can record yourself during practice, and then listen to your speech until you are accustomed to your voice and way of speaking.
